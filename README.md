MVP User Stories for Disaster Response AI Agent Flow:
As a caller, I want to be greeted with a disclaimer informing me that this is not a 911 service, so that I know this call is for non-emergency situations.

As a caller, I want to hear a sympathetic and helpful agent who speaks slowly and calmly, so that I feel calm and supported during the call.

As a caller, I want to provide my location to the agent, so that my information can be logged for disaster response and resource allocation.

As a caller, I want to provide a temporary location if I am unable to stay at my current location, so that the system can direct me to available resources in a safer place if needed.

As a caller, I want to tell the agent about my immediate needs (e.g., medical help, shelter, food, water) so that I can receive assistance based on my situation.

As a disaster response agent, I want to log the callerâ€™s location, needs, and temporary location (if provided), so that I can record and prioritize the information for further action.

As a disaster response system, I want to send an email to a roster of local volunteers with the logged caller information (location, needs, and temporary location), so that volunteers can take action and provide assistance.
